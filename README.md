# Justice-Media-co-Lab-NAACP-GBH-Media-Bias-project
For the past year, the NAACP and WGBH have partnered with BU Spark! to analyze bias in coverage of Black communities and Black neighborhoods in Boston. The goal is to develop a product that builds upon prior work to create a  bias-mitigating Human-AI system that can be used by newsrooms and media organizations to assess bias in their coverage historically and in real-time. This project would refine current models to develop methods for detecting nuanced and subtle bias based on racist frames, narratives, and interpretations. The value of this tool to our partners is to provide a mechanism for real-time assessment of coverage that will enable a proactive approach to not only removing bias but advancing antiracist practices and dialogue among reporters and editors in their newsrooms.
